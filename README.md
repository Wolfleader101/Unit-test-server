# Unit-test-server
 Server for unit-test-app
 just do node main.js to launch.
 Watch input through dev tools.
 Format and user data section coming soon.
 Sending a request through submit button on this server will not do anything,
 run both projects and press submit on the Angular app when you have inputed these fields, watch in devtools console and the servers console as it outputs the inputed fields sending out an array.
